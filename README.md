# amazon-zktls

Trustless escrow for "buy-this-Amazon-item-for-me" bounties on Aztec, settled by a Primus
zkTLS attestation that the item was actually delivered to the order creator's address.

## How it works

1. **Order creator** posts a private bounty on Aztec: _"pay AMOUNT in USDC to whoever
   delivers ASIN X to address H."_ Address is committed (poseidon2 over packed shipping
   lines) so it stays private.
2. **Filler** buys the item on Amazon, has it shipped to the creator's real address, and
   visits the [frontend](packages/frontend/) to attest the order summary page via
   Primus zkTLS. The browser runs the Noir circuit in-process and produces a proof whose
   public outputs are `(asin, grand_total, address_commitment, nullifier)`.
3. **Filler claims** by calling `fill_order` on the escrow. The contract re-runs the
   verifier inline (same Noir lib the browser used), asserts `asin` and
   `address_commitment` match the order, gates on an admin-curated attestor pubkey
   registry, pushes both the proof nullifier and the order's fill nullifier, and pays
   the filler.

The chain stores nothing about the buyer's identity, the shipping address, or the order
contents — only commitments. Replay across orders is blocked by the proof nullifier;
double-fill of a single order by the config nullifier.

## Layout

```
packages/
├── circuit/    Noir circuit + TS prover. Verifies a Primus attestation and
│               extracts (asin, grand_total, address_commitment, nullifier).

├── contracts/  Aztec contracts: AmazonEscrow (per-order private escrow that
│               re-runs the circuit lib inline) + AttestorKeyOracle (admin-
│               curated PublicImmutable map of allowed pubkey hashes).
│
└── frontend/   Next.js app. Drives the browser-side flow: attest via
                Primus, prove with bb.js, render the public outputs ready
                for an on-chain fill.
```

Each package has its own README with build/test specifics.

## Versions

- Aztec **`v4.2.0-aztecnr-rc.2`** for both `aztec-nr` and `aztec-standards`. Compile
  scripts PATH-prefix `$HOME/.aztec/current/bin` so aztec's bundled nargo (beta.18)
  wins over a system nargo (beta.20) — `aztec-nr` v4.2.0 doesn't compile under beta.20.
- Noir **`1.0.0-beta.18`** (via aztec).
- bb.js **`3.0.0-nightly.20260102`** for browser proving.

## Quick start

```sh
git clone --recurse-submodules <repo>
cd amazon-zktls
pnpm install

# Build everything (Noir + TS).
pnpm -r build

# Frontend dev server.
pnpm dev

# Contracts test (in another terminal: aztec start --local-network).
pnpm test:contracts
```

## Technical deficiencies

If we move forward with this, here's the open backlog:

- Need to handle multiple countries (specifically India to start) since that is the
  narrative / use case.
- Need to optimize — most important: switch Primus mode from sha hashes to Pedersen
  commitments.
- Order discovery off-chain and handle order-fill failure paths on-chain.
- ASIN constraining — we need to make sure you can't post an Amazon item where the
  name of the product shown on amazon.com isn't actually the product number.
- Attestation pub keys are public immutable and should be delayed-public mutable.
- Forked the Primus SDK since they have a number of incompatibilities with Noir beta.20.
- Actually had to downgrade to .18 which still isn't compatible with Primus; need to
  get on the latest testnet version.
- Per-field `MAX_*` bounds in `amazon_zktls_lib` share one ceiling per axis — tighten
  them to save sha256 constraints.
- Soundness gap in the circuit: public inputs (`recipient`, `timestamp`, `hashes`,
  attestor pubkey) aren't bound to `hash` in-circuit. v2 should reconstruct the
  canonical Primus message and assert `keccak256(canonical) == hash`.
- I used Claude, there's slop, don't @ me.
